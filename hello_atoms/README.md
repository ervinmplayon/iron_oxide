# Macros vs Functions
`println!()` calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it would be entered as `println()` without the `!`. Rust macros are a way to write code that generates code to extend Rust syntax. Using a `!` means that you are calling a macro instead of a normal function and macros don't always follow the same rules as functions.
